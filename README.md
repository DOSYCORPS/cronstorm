# kairoi &mdash; everything has a time

Everything has a right time.  
To every thing a season.  
With kairoi that time is now.  
Or whenever you want it to be.  
To the ancient Greeks, kairoi meant "the right times", or "the fated times".  
But to you, kairoi means *"Time-as-a-Service"*.  

## Getting it

```shell/bash
npm i -g kairoi

Some people need to use `sudo` with `-g`
